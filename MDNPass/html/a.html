    <p><a href="#Mailing_address"><h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1></a>

        This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
    
        Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.
